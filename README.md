# Simple pen

Super simple screen annotation software which allows to draw:
* line,
* rectangle,
* charts (using matplotlib).

Right mouse click stops the program.

The application allows to write directly on the screen.
* For Linux transparent background is used.
* For Windows the screenshot is taken and user draws on the captured image.
